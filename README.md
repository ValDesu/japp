## 🔜 Future Development

🛑Right now, we are just putting out a proof of concept. For the released version of JAPP, the dictionary will be in our own database (stop using Jisho API), and the cards-deck relationship will be different, optimizing queries and statistics.🛑

We're always working to improve JAPP, and we have big plans for the future, including:

- Authentication with Google account to keep track of your activities and stats! 🔐
- Continued development and optimization to make JAPP the best Japanese learning app on the market! 🥇
- Using AI to generate personalized output exercices based on your deck's vocab, and give you feedback ! 🤖
